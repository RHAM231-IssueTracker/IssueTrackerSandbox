# IssueTrackerSandbox
Sandbox repository for demo purposes.

## Motivation
This repository is linked to my project, Issue Tracker, which interfaces with GitHub's public API to create, update, open, and close GitHub Issues.

## Background
The code for Issue Tracker can be found on my personal GitHub. See Issue Tracker's About page or [README](https://github.com/RHAM231/IssueTracker/blob/master/README.md) for more background about the site's functionality and purpose.
