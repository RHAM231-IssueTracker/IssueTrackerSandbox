# IssueTrackerSandbox
Sandbox repository for demo purposes.

## Motivation
This repository is linked to my project, Issue Tracker, which interfaces with GitHub's public API to create, update, open, and close GitHub Issues.

## Background
The code for Issue Tracker can be found on my GitHub. See Issue Tracker's About page or README for more background about functionality and purpose.
